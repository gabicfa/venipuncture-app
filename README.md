# Venipuncture App

An android app was developed for a project in partnership with nursing master’s students from Albert Einstein Hospital. The app allows children to understand the venipuncture procedure in a ludic and interactive manner. Its development occurred in three stages: identification of client’s needs, the definition of components, and prototype elaboration. Besides being directed to the care and education of children and families, the app meets the nurses’ needs to prepare them for venipuncture.
